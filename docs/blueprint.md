# **App Name**: AgriBot

## Core Features:

- Agricultural Query Chatbot: Provide real-time answers to farmers' agricultural queries using NLP. This feature enables farmers to ask questions about crop management, soil health, and other farming-related topics, receiving instant, helpful responses.
- Crop Recommendation Tool: Recommend crops based on soil parameters. Users can input their soil data, and the tool will suggest the most suitable crops for their land, improving yield and resource efficiency.
- Image-Based Disease Prediction: Predict crop diseases using image analysis. Farmers upload pictures of affected plants, and the system analyzes them to provide accurate diagnoses and treatment suggestions, powered by AI. The LLM uses reasoning to decide when and if to suggest one of its image processing tools.
- User-Friendly Interface: Develop a clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction with the chatbot.
- Real-time Notifications: Provide users with real-time notifications for critical updates, such as disease outbreaks or soil condition changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#8FBC8F) to reflect agriculture and nature. A dark scheme is appropriate, given the importance of visualizing diagnostic images without unwanted glare.
- Background color: Dark green (#2F4F4F), a very desaturated version of the primary.
- Accent color: Light brown (#B8860B), an analogous hue to the primary, with more brightness and saturation to create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern and clear sans-serif font, for a clean and accessible design.
- Use clear and recognizable icons to represent different functionalities within the app, such as crop selection, disease analysis, and soil monitoring.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as loading animations during disease prediction and smooth transitions between screens.
